### Cloud Computing:
	- Cloud is a network of remote servers.
	- Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing resources over internet.
	- computing resources - Ex : Storage - SSD, DB, Software, etc.

### Advantages of Cloud Computing:
	1. No need to maintain physical Data Center.
		- Capital Expenses = 0
		- Operational Cost = Pay as you go
	2. Auto scaling feature.
	3. Unlimited capacity.
	4. Go global in minutes.
	
### Types of Cloud:
	1. Private Cloud - Works on private infrastructure. A single organization or business uses this cloud.
	2. Public Cloud - A third-party provider owns and operates the cloud, which is accessible to anyone over the internet.
	3. Hybrid Cloud 
 		- Combination of private cloud with a public cloud. 
 		- store sensitive data on-premises while using the cloud for less sensitive data.

### Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling:
 - Horizontal scaling adds more machines to distribute the workload, offering better fault tolerance and near-infinite scalability, while vertical scaling increases the resources of a single machine, such as CPU or RAM, to boost its performance. 

### Cloud Service Models:
1.	IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):
IaaS is a type of cloud computing that provides users with access to computing resources, like servers, storage, and networking. It allows users to rent these resources on a pay-as-you-go basis, so they don't need to invest in hardware or software upfront. 
IaaS customers have full control over the virtual machines and can install and configure their own software and applications.
Ex: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Engine (GCE)

2. PAAS - Platform as a Service
PaaS is a cloud computing model in which customers can develop, run, and manage web applications without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. PaaS provides customers a platform to build and deploy applications quickly and easily.
Ex: AWS RDS

3. SAAS - Software as a Service:
SaaS is a cloud computing model in which software applications are hosted on a remote server, and customers access them through a web browser. SaaS eliminates the need for customers to install and manage the software on their own systems.
Ex: Office 365, Gmail

### Latency:
 - latency is the delay between a request sent from a user's device and the response from a cloud server, measured in milliseconds, and is influenced by factors like physical distance, network congestion, server processing time, and the number of network hops. High latency leads to slow performance.

### AWS Global Infrastructure
 - The AWS Global Infrastructure comprises AWS Regions and Availability Zones.

### Regions and Availability Zones:
 - AWS Regions are separate geographic areas. AWS Regions consist of multiple, physically separated and isolated Availability zones that are connected with low latency, high throughput, highly redundant networking. 
Availability zones consist of one or more discrete data centres, each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, and housed in separate facilities.
